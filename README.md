## Overview

For this assignment, I created an employee directory with React. The app has a responsive table that reads from a data-table of employees, and is responsive to each of the categories in the table.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
